	abstract = {Untargeted metabolomics involves a large-scale comparison of the fragmentation pattern of a mass spectrum against a database containing known spectra. Given the number of comparisons involved, this step can be time-consuming. In this work, we present a GPU-accelerated cosine similarity implementation for Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS) with approximately 1000-fold speedup compared to the MatchMS reference at a rate of 0.005\% incorrect matches and a rate of 0.002\% incorrect scores. We describe the underlying reasons for these errors and provide means to avoid them.},

  abstract = {We present a conceptual study on the realization of functional and easily scalable all-optical NOT, 
  AND and NAND logic gates using bandgap solitons in coupled photonic crystal waveguides. 
  The underlying structure consists of a planar air-hole type photonic crystal with a hexagonal lattice of air holes 
  in crystalline silicon (c-Si) as the nonlinear background material. The remaining logical operations can be performed using
   combinations of these three logic gates. A unique feature of the proposed working scheme is that it operates in the true time-domain,
  enabling temporal solitons to maintain a stable pulse envelope during each logical operation. Hence, multiple concatenated all-optical
  logic gates can be easily realized, paving the way to multiple-input all-optical logic gates for ultrafast full-optical digital
  signal processing. In the suggested setup, there is no need to amplify the output signal after each operation, which can be
  directly used as a new input signal for another logical operation. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed logic gates
  as well as their scalability is demonstrated using our original rigorous theoretical formalism together with full-wave computational
   electromagnetics.},

  abstract = "The realization of all-optical AND logic gates for pulsed signal
              operation based on the photonic bandgap transmission phenomenon
              is proposed. We are using realistic planar air-hole type coupled
              photonic crystal waveguides (C-PCWs) with Kerr-type nonlinear
              background medium. The novelty of our analysis is that the
              proposed AND logic gate operates with the temporal solitons,
              which maintain a stable envelope propagating in the nonlinear
              C-PCWs, enabling true ultrafast full-optical digital signal
              processing in the time-domain. The bandgap transmission takes
              place when the operating frequency is chosen at the very edge of
              the dispersion curve of one of the supermodes in the C-PCWs. In
              this regard, our original fast and accurate method is used to
              efficiently calculate the supermodes of the C-PCW system. The
              underlying semi-analytical full-wave modal analysis is based on
              the evaluation of the lattice sums for complex wavenumbers using
              the transition-matrix method in combination with the generalized
              reflection-matrix approach. As a proof of concept successful
              pulse operation of the all-optical AND logic gate is demonstrated
              in the framework of extensive full-wave finite-difference
              time-domain electromagnetics analysis.",
