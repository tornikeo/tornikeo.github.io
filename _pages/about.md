Iâ€™m a full-stack machine learning engineer. I take client requirements and deliver the end-user tool/product. I handle all of the usual stages, from feasibility evaluation to inference optimization, to long-term API maintenance. This makes it easy for clients to get the result they are looking for, quickly.

## Education

I received my B.Eng. from [Free University of Tbilisi](https://freeuni.edu.ge/en) in 2015. Throughout I've worked as an assistant research scientist on [FDTD simulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-difference_time-domain_method) and co-authored two papers ([1](https://doi.org/10.3390/photonics8070250), [2](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-28-12-18317&id=432364)) on the topic. 


As of 2024, I'm enrolled at [LUT](https://www.lut.fi/en), in [M.Sc. Data-centric Engineering](https://www.lut.fi/en/studies/technology/masters-programmes-technology/data-centric-engineering-maisteriohjelma), in Finland.

## Am I the right fit for YOUR project?

Here's a checklist:

- Project needs to be written in Python
- Service provider is either Google Cloud or AWS
- The project can't be written with just the traditional programming (i.e. you need AI)
- There are no obvious drag-n-drop product that can satisfy your requirements.

If your project satisfies the above checklist, be sure to contact me at **tornikeonoprishvili [at] gmail.com**
