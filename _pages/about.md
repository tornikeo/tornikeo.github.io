I'm a Machine Learning engineer with a fair few years of work experience. Mostly in applied machine learning and inference cost-optimization on cloud. Currently learning to apply my trade to computational chemistry.

This website serves as a hub for project write-ups and technical discussions. I store pretty much all the useful, non-rigorous text in here. 

Right now I'm working on a new BART-style foundation model for tandem mass spectrometry. Before that I've authored a CUDA kernel for cost-efficient search in mass spectrometry called [SimMS](https://github.com/PangeAI/simms) and wrote a [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.24.605006v1). Even before *that* I did a [number](https://tornikeo.github.io/projects/) of smaller AI/ML projects.

## Tech stack
- Python, CUDA C++
- PyTorch and Jax
- Linux, Git, Docker
- Google Cloud and AWS
- NVIDIA GPUs *and* TPUs

## Education
I'm currently completing an MSc. degree at [LUT University](https://www.lut.fi/en) with double degree at [Universit√† della Svizzera italiana](https://www.usi.ch/it).
