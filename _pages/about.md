I'm a Machine Learning engineer with 5 years of work experience, mostly in applied machine learning and inference cost-optimization in the cloud. I'm currently learning to apply my trade to computational chemistry.

This website serves as a hub for project write-ups and technical discussions. I store pretty much all the useful, non-rigorous text on here.

These days I'm working on my master thesis "GPU-accelerated simulation of mass spectometry" at [Università della Svizzera Italiana](https://www.usi.ch/) (USI). Previously I've authored a parallel GPU program for fast mass spectra search called [SimMS](https://github.com/PangeAI/simms) and wrote a [paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaf081/8026685). I Even before *that* I did a [number](https://tornikeo.github.io/projects/) of smaller AI/ML projects.

## Tech stack
- Python, CUDA C++
- PyTorch and Jax
- Linux, Git, Docker
- Google Cloud and AWS
- NVIDIA GPUs *and* Google TPUs

## Education
I'm currently doing an MSc. degree at [LUT University](https://www.lut.fi/en) in Finland with double degree at [Università della Svizzera italiana](https://www.usi.ch/it) in Switzerland. I got my BSc. Eng. at [Free University of Tbilisi](https://freeuni.edu.ge/en) in Georgia.
