Iâ€™m a full-stack machine learning engineer. My work is researching, deploying and explaining, as quickly as possible.

I'm especially skilled in independently creating AI-based web-services from scratch, using low-cost GPU providers. This is especially helpful for startups and small-to-mid-sized companies looking for PoC AI tools.

## Education

I graduated from [Free University of Tbilisi](https://freeuni.edu.ge/en) with B.Eng. in 2015 ([score transcript]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/score-transcript.pdf)).

In 2018, as an undergraduate research scientist, I worked on waveguide [simulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-difference_time-domain_method) in MatLab, co-authored two papers and presented them in [Toyama](https://www.piers.org/piers2018Toyama/reg.php) and [Rome](https://www.piers.org/piers2019Rome/) research symposia.

## Employment

In 2019, after graduating, I began working as a data scientist, first for [Orient Logic](https://www.ol.ge/en), and later for [ACT Inc.](https://act-global.com/en/main/georgia). Designed a Credit Card Fraud detection system and created collaborative filtering system for pharmaceutical retail stores. 

In January 2021, I joined UpWork as a [Freelance AI specialist](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01a3aea673f4f7db6c).  

Some of the best projects I've worked on are:

- [Lightweight pose estimation]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/pose_estim/)
- [Serverless stable diffusion]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/serverless_diffusion/)
- [Image super-resolution]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/swinir_superres/)
- [Body shape estimation from a video]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/shapy/)  

... [and more]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/)

I have extensive experience in Python, I know my way around git, and docker, and have comprehensive experience with both Tensorflow, and PyTorch. Last but not least, I have solid knowledge of statistics and linear algebra.
