Virtual Reality has grown in popularity in recent years, resulting in a plethora of popular games for the technology. As a result, having a game design with an adaptive level of difficulty is important for a wide range of players.
This research looked into how deep learning may be used to accurately estimate the pupil diameter of virtual reality users depending on the amount of light they are exposed to. Deep learning will be used to measure the workload and stress levels of users. This investigation is significant since it revealed a new way to assess users' workload and stress levels.

So, the question is, how do we leverage this new data to predict just how stressed out, or, conversely, bored, our users are?
