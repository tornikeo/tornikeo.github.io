The very first project at [Luxolis](http://luxolis.ai/) was concerned with using AI to estimate person's 3D *mesh* from a video stream. And, I mean an accurate, bodyshape aware estimation. 

To make absolutely clear what I mean by "bodyshape aware", here's an excerpt from the abstract of [SHAPY paper](https://ps.is.mpg.de/uploads_file/attachment/attachment/691/00928.pdf):

> *While methods that regress 3D human meshes from im-
ages have progressed rapidly, the estimated body shapes of-
ten do not capture the true human shape. This is problematic since, for many applications, accurate body shape is as
important as pose. The key reason that body shape accuracy
lags pose accuracy is the lack of data*

In fact, SHAPY allows to actually predict the standard measurements for chest, waist, hips (CWH), in addition to height, weight and a whole other body measurement parameters. While many other methods in 3D mesh estimation use just a default human mesh, SHAPY creates an accurate human body mesh, in addition to an accurate 3D posture of the said mesh.
