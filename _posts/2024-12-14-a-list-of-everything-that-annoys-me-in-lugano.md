# The List 

**Currently work-in-progress**

We divide these things into categories. University-related, home-related and city-related. 

## The University

I study in the Eastern (new) campus. Let's list the annoyances.

### **There's no clothing storage room**
You can't store you clothes anywhere, safely. At the start of the studies, I accidentally hang
my coat on a mobile coat rack. Silly me. Staff took the hanger with my coat away. Surely it's still somewhere in the storage room, but 
I have yet to find it. 

### **Lockers are always 100% full**
Lockers for students are always 100% full. Students take all of them up the moment they become available in January and then keep them occupied throughout the entire year. If you don't manage to take up locker space at that moment -- tough luck. Wait for another year.

### **Library is closed**
Library is closed with a keycard at all times. This is actually the first university that I've seen that does this. Neither Free University nor LUT did this. You can't go in or out without a key, at any point in time. This is annoying as hell.

### **Library doesn't have computers**

Actually, there are no "university" computers here at all. At LUT the library had a lot of additional monitors for work. I used to hook up my laptop to work on a dual screen. It saved me a lot of neck-ache. Well, not in here. Also the Library is really small.

### **Cafeteria is expensive and poor...**

...at the same time. Expensive in the sense that the cheapest and the only choice of food is around CHF 12. Poor, in the sense that the choice for allergy-friendly food isn't really there. Personal example: I couldn't get anything lactose-free. There is no real choice in food. You either eat what is given or not eat in here.

### **No meeting booths**

Since the building is torus-shaped, the students just kind of hang around in the narrow corridors around the 1st floor. Unfortunately, the meeting "booths" available for students are not really "booths". These are uncovered partial boxes that don't really block the noise at all. Thus it's almost impossible to have a meeting inside. Outside, it's even worse. Since virtually every surface is covered with concrete, without even a hint of greenery, the noise really echoes around. 

## **Everything is gray, dull concrete**

Everything is covered in gray, dull concrete at the university. There's no single wall or road that has a different color. Gray, cold and dull. At least they have a defibrilator here and there -- an understandable necessity given the heart-wrenching visage around here.

## **Gym locker room seats**

The locker room in Gym has seats made of narrow wood beams. The space between beams is wide enough that you can't really put most things on them. If you want to put down your shirt or pants, it will fall through.

## The home

I live at a newly-built Via Beltramina apartment. Like a cruel irony, the building itself is also fully concrete-colored. Only a single large black-on-gray sign "Via Beltramina 9" breaks up the gray exterior of the building. 

It's obvious that the annoyances with home are 100% only my fault. But these are annoyance still, so here I list them.

### **Apartment is tiny**

The apartment is tiny. There's barely any room to do anything. We wanted to have a drying hanger. There's no room for it. 

### **Apartment is expensive**

Current apartment is both around 2x smaller, and also 2x more expensive at the same time, compared to the apartment in Lappeenranta. This makes it around 4x more expensive, per $m^2$ compared with Lappeenranta. There are no upsides with this one.

### **Internet speed is bad**

Compared to Finland, our internet service provider here (sunrise) offers a worse service. Internet frequently goes down to 1-2Mb/s speeds during the evening. At times there are interruptions of 5-10 minutes when we aren't even connected to the internet. Sunrise was unable to address these issues even after calling. Cancelling your subscription isn't easy either. You can't do it online. You have to call, wait and sunrise usually offers only contracts that can't be cancelled before term (which is around 1 year minimum). 

### **Laundry is shared**

I was a believer that laundry room could and should be shared, when I was in Finland. The room looked clean there and well-ventilated. However, in here, it's mandatory to use the shared room. Unfortunately, the room is a mess. There's so much floating dust in the room that the dried clothes actually look a bit gray. People or a few ~~bad~~ lazy occupants just seem to not clean the machines after use. That, and the basement is really poorly ventilated, causing all dust to accumulate to indescribable levels.

## The city

The city is beautiful, but it has a lot of annoying little problems.

### **Traffic lights don't beep when green**

Traffic lights usually have a beeper. When it turns green, there's a little sound that lets you know this. Good for people with vision problems, or ones looking at their phones. For some reason, there's not a single beeper-enabled traffic light in the whole of Lugano.


### **Sidewalks are tiny**

Sidewalks are usually so tiny and close to the car lane that you actually can't go around people going in opposite directions. You have to wait until there are no cars around and then quickly run around people, on the street.


### **Constant traffic**

Cars. There are so many cars. Car noise, dust and exhaust are all the nice things that Lugano is full of. Biking somewhere frequently feels like a risk. 

### **Bikes are damaged and app is buggy**

City bikes are frequently damaged, and the app for using those is usually out of sync with your rental. Ah, and the subscription has a minimum of 1 year. Also bike handles have these -- I can't even describe what these are -- frills on their handles. My spouse swears that she can't feel them, but after biking I usually come home with a tiny needly pricking sensation in the corners of my palms. These prickly needles can be visually seen under a direct light - they glisten a bit. I don't know what they are made of, possibly some leftover fiber? At any rate, driving a bike here without a glove is a pain -- literally.

Also, don't even try to *pause* your bike. I couldn't re-open the bike after pausing it. We contacted support and it took them around 2 weeks to finally stop the ride. Within the app the timer had gone up to 300 hours. We didn't get billed for that, thank God, but that was nerve-wracking.
