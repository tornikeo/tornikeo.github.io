The current AI GPUs will become unemployeable at some point. Maybe after the AI bubble bursts, or maybe after the consumer hardware becomes generally capable of running GPT-4o-level AIs, or possibly after semiconductor designers design better GPUs. This is bound to happen at some point.

The most interesting scientific algorithms are the ones too compute-hungry to use. Frequently, these algorithms can "fit" inside an AI GPU. When the algorithm "fits", it typically becomes 100x or 1000x faster compared to the original algorithm. The process of "fitting" requires GPU programming. 

Right now it is a good time to learn how to program a GPU. Rewrite the current intractable-but-useful scientific algorithms to a GPU. Write a paper about it, and publish it. As time goes on and GPU hardware advances, your re-implementation will become the most accessible door for the researchers.
