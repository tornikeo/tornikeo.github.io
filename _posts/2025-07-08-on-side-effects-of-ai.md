The current AI GPUs will become unemployeable at some point. Maybe after the AI bubble bursts, or maybe after the consumer hardware becomes generally capable of running GPT-4o-level AIs, or possibly after semiconductor designers design better GPUs. This is bound to happen at some point.

The most interesting scientific algorithms are the ones too compute-hungry to use. They are interesting because most researchers can't afford to run them. Frequently, these algorithms can "fit" inside an AI GPU. When the algorithm "fits" on a GPU, it typically becomes 100x or 1000x faster. A single GPU now produces results matching that of a university supercomputer. Now, the algorithm has become generally accessible, because you have opened the gates for the others.

Right now it is the best time to learn how to program a GPU. Rewrite the current intractable-but-useful scientific algorithms to a GPU. Write a paper about how you did it. Publish the paper. As time goes on and GPU hardware advances, your re-implementation will become the most accessible door to the computation for the researchers.
