I've never seen a dev job post looking for a "professional code hygienist". Why? Isn't [code a form of debt](https://tornikeo.com/code-is-debt/)? 

Have you seen what the staff-only room looks like at a Starbucks?

It is a cramped, messy-looking room. There's not a client that'd would want to be near that room. 
But most clients never seem to complain about it. Clients simply ignore the room and pay for the hot beverage.

Have you seen what the codebase looks like at an $ENTERPRISE?

It is a vast, mess-filled warehouse. There's not a client that'd would want to be near that warehouse. 
But most clients never seem to complain about it. Clients simply ignore the warehouse and pay for the services.

The world is a messy place. We work for someone who pays us to handle their mess. When you handle *all* the mess the client wants handled, you get a collosal, beyond-understanding codebase.
