"Will AI replace human programmers?"

Have you heard of the [Ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus)? Actually the question above has a lot to do with this piece of Greek mythology. You see the Ship of Theseus was decaying from time. People went in and they replaced the planks with new timber, the oars with new crafts, and the sails of a ship with new linen. 

There's almost nothing remaining of the original ship. Surely the ship was replaced, right? People tend to disagree here, but I think the answer is yes. The ship was replaced just with one piece at a time. This is a new ship now.

So, now we see AI replacing *some* planks of the ship that is the "human programming". No longer we need to spend time and money on simple projects that aren't safety-critical. A bit of human programming has most definitely and without any doubt, been replaced.

We are here now. AI can do some things. And no, you can not build the next Google without humans yet. I hope this answers your question.
