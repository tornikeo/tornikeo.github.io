title: "Carcinization of programming"
description: Every language evolves into a type-safe language after a while
---

Every language either is strongly typed or becomes one after sufficient use. 

All languages seem to do this, not just programming languages. Examples:

- [Legalese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_English) is close to being a type-safe English (...and is maddeningly verbose).
- Java was, is and will be strongly typed (and is, similarly, verbose). I am not aware of any tool that removes typing from Java.
- JavaScript isn't strongly typed, but now everything I interact with recommends using TypeScript instead (TypeScript is incredibly verbose). 
- Python isn't strongly typed, and now with so many Python projects around, types and type-safety become important (and bet your ass it will be verbose).

In short, every language that is used sufficiently frequently will become de facto type-safe and verbose. Just like [carcinization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinisation), type-safetization seems inevitable.

What about vibecoding? Isn't it a sort of wobbly programming language? Surely enough, as software using it becomes useful, [prompts](https://gist.github.com/agokrani/919b536246dd272a55157c21d46eda14) become more and more like a type-safe language.

Maybe this carcinization of programming is a byproduct of the complexity of the world? You can't really avoid it once you want your software to actually do useful things.
