title: "Carcinization of programming"
description: Why everything becomes type-safe after a while
---

Every language either is strongly typed or becomes one after sufficient use. 

Any language - not just programming languages mind you. Examples:
- Legalese simply is a strongly typed English (...and is maddeningly verbose).
- Java was, is and will be strongly typed (and is, similarly verbose).
- JavaScript wasn't strongly typed at the start but TypeScript showed how useful it is (ahem verbose). 
- Python wasn't strongly typed, and now with so many projects in Python, typing and type-safety become important (and bet your ass it will be verbose).

In short, every language that is used sufficiently frequently will become de-facto type-safe and verbose.

What about vibecoding? Isn't it a sort of a programming language? Surely enough, vibe-coded software that survives long enough will become as verbose as legalese and just as type safe. 

Maybe this carcinization of programming is a byproduct of the complexity of the world? You can't really avoid it once you publish your software.
